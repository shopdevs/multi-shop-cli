## What is Multi-Shop?

ShopDevs Multi-Shop transforms any Shopify theme into a sophisticated multi-shop system with:

- **Contextual Development** - One command adapts to your branch context
- **Automated Shop Syncing** - PRs auto-created when main updates
- **Campaign Tools** (v2.3.0+) - One-command campaign lifecycle management
- **Content Protection** (v2.3.0+) - Config-based safeguards against content overwrites
- **Health Check** (v2.3.0+) - Diagnostic tool for shop configuration verification
- **Secure Credentials** - Developer-specific tokens stored locally only
- **Shop Isolation** - Complete separation between shop customizations
- **Modern GitHub Flow** - Simple, PR-based development workflow

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install and initialize
cd your-shopify-theme
pnpm add -D @shopdevs/multi-shop-cli && npx multi-shop init

# Create your first shop
pnpm run shop

# Start contextual development
pnpm run dev
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Content vs Code Separation

**READ THIS FIRST:** Shopify themes contain both **code** (structure) and **content** (settings, text). Multi-shop workflows require careful separation.

### ‚ú® Built-In Protection

**Good news!** The CLI automatically detects content file changes and warns you:

**üö® Cross-Shop Sync** (strict warnings + confirmation):
- Syncing `main` ‚Üí `shop-a/staging`: **BLOCKS** and requires confirmation
- Syncing `feature/test` ‚Üí `my-store/staging`: **BLOCKS** and requires confirmation
- Shows which content files would be overwritten
- Requires explicit confirmation to proceed

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Within-Shop Sync** (informational only):
- Syncing `shop-a/main` ‚Üí `shop-a/staging`: Just **INFO**, no blocking
- Syncing `my-awesome-shop/promo` ‚Üí `my-awesome-shop/main`: Just **INFO**
- Content changes are expected and safe

**Works for ANY shop name!** Automatically detects shop context.

### The Challenge

When you sync changes from `main` to shop branches, you risk overwriting shop-specific customizations:

**Content Files (Shop-Specific - DO NOT sync from main):**
- `config/settings_data.json` - Colors, fonts, layouts set in Theme Editor
- `templates/*.json` - Page layouts and section configurations
- `locales/*.json` - Translations and text content

**Code Files (Shared - SAFE to sync):**
- `.liquid` files - Templates, sections, snippets
- `.css`, `.js` files - Styling and interactivity
- `config/settings_schema.json` - Settings schema (not values)

### What To Do

**When you see STRICT warning (cross-shop):**
1. **Review PR carefully** before merging
2. **DO NOT merge** changes to content files
3. **ONLY merge** code file updates (.liquid, .css, .js)
4. Consider using `.gitattributes` merge strategy (see below)

**When you see SOFT info (within-shop):**
- ‚úÖ Normal workflow, proceed as usual
- Content changes are expected within the same shop

**See:** [CONTENT-PHILOSOPHY.md](../CONTENT-PHILOSOPHY.md) for complete guide, detection logic, and advanced strategies.

## Core Concepts

### Contextual Development

The CLI automatically adapts to your branch context:

**Feature Branches** (`feature/name`):
- Prompts for shop selection
- Test across multiple shops
- Code stays on feature branch

**Shop Branches** (`shop-a/name`):
- Auto-detects shop context
- Starts immediately
- Shop-specific development

### Branch Strategy

```
main (core theme)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/carousel-fix         # Contextual development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/critical-bug          # Emergency fixes
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shop-a/main                  # Connected to shop-a
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shop-a/staging           # Connected to staging-shop-a
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shop-a/promo-summer      # Campaign branches
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shop-b/main                  # Connected to shop-b
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shop-b/staging           # Connected to staging-shop-b
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shop-b/promo-holiday     # Campaign branches
```

### Security Model

**Configuration** (committed):
- Shop ID, name, domains
- Branch names
- Authentication method
- NO credentials

**Credentials** (local only):
- Developer name
- Theme access tokens
- Never committed
- 600 permissions (Unix/macOS/Linux)

## Common Use Cases

### Core Feature Development

Build features that apply to all shops:

1. Create feature branch from main
2. Test across different shop contexts
3. Create PR directly to main (GitHub Flow)
4. Use Tools ‚Üí Sync Shops to deploy to all shops

### Shop-Specific Customization

Build features for one shop only:

1. Create shop-specific branch
2. Auto-detected contextual development
3. Create PR to shop's main branch
4. Deploy to that shop only

### Campaign Management (v2.3.0+)

Run promotions and campaigns with automated tools:

1. **Create Promo Branch** - One command creates campaign branch
2. **Connect to Shopify** - Link branch to preview theme
3. **Customize** - Edit in Shopify admin (auto-syncs)
4. **Launch** - Publish campaign theme
5. **Push to Main** - One command creates PR to merge content back
6. **List Promos** - See all active campaigns across shops
7. **End Promo** - Clean up after campaign completes
