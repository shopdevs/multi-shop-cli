# üîÑ Multi-Shop Development Workflows

Complete guide to the multi-shop development workflows supported by ShopDevs Multi-Shop.

## üìã Overview

This system supports two distinct development patterns:

1. **Core Feature Development** - Non-shop-specific features and bugfixes (GitHub Flow)
2. **Shop-Specific Development** - Shop customizations, campaigns, and promos

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Feature Development Workflow (GitHub Flow)

For features that apply to all shops (components, bugfixes, core functionality):

### Branch Flow
```
feature/your-feature ‚Üí main ‚Üí shop-*/staging ‚Üí shop-*/main
```

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/carousel-fix
```

#### 2. Develop with Contextual Testing
```bash
pnpm run dev
# ‚Üí Detects feature branch
# ‚Üí Prompts: "Select shop for testing"
# ‚Üí Choose: shop-a (staging)
# ‚Üí Shopify CLI starts with shop-a staging credentials
```

Test the same code against different shops:
```bash
pnpm run dev
# ‚Üí Choose: shop-b (staging)  
# ‚Üí Test same feature in different shop context
```

#### 3. Create PR to Main (GitHub Flow)
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Fix carousel responsive issues"
git push -u origin feature/carousel-fix

# Direct to main (GitHub Flow):
gh pr create --base main --title "Fix carousel responsive issues"

# Or get instructions:
multi-shop workflow feature
# ‚Üí Shows exact PR commands
```

#### 4. Main Review & Merge
- Team reviews PR: `feature/carousel-fix ‚Üí main`
- After approval and merge to main

#### 5. Auto-Deploy to Shops (Optional GitHub Action)
After merge to main, either:

**Option A: GitHub Action (if configured)**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/shop-sync.yml automatically creates:
# main ‚Üí shop-a/staging
# main ‚Üí shop-b/staging  
# main ‚Üí shop-c/staging
```

**Option B: Manual PRs**
```bash
multi-shop workflow deploy
# ‚Üí Shows commands for creating shop PRs:
# gh pr create --base shop-a/staging --head main --title "Deploy carousel fix"
# gh pr create --base shop-b/staging --head main --title "Deploy carousel fix"
```

#### 6. Shop Team Review
Each shop team reviews their staging PR:
- `main ‚Üí shop-a/staging` (approved by shop-a team)
- `main ‚Üí shop-b/staging` (approved by shop-b team)

#### 7. Deploy to Shop Production
After staging approval:
```bash
gh pr create --base shop-a/main --head shop-a/staging --title "Deploy carousel fix to shop-a production"
gh pr create --base shop-b/main --head shop-b/staging --title "Deploy carousel fix to shop-b production"
```

## üéØ Shop-Specific Development Workflow

For shop customizations, campaigns, and promos:

### Customization Flow
```
shop-a/main ‚Üí shop-a/custom-feature ‚Üí shop-a/main
```

### Promo Flow  
```
shop-a/main ‚Üí shop-a/promo-sale ‚Üí [Shopify content] ‚Üí shop-a/main
```

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Shop Customization

1. **Create Shop Branch**
```bash
git checkout shop-a/main
git pull origin shop-a/main
git checkout -b shop-a/custom-fitness-calculator
```

2. **Auto-Detected Development**
```bash
pnpm run dev
# ‚Üí Auto-detects: shop-a
# ‚Üí Automatically starts dev server for shop-a staging
# ‚Üí No shop selection needed!
```

3. **Create Shop-Specific PR**
```bash
gh pr create --base shop-a/main --title "Add fitness calculator for shop-a"
```

#### Campaign/Promo Workflow

1. **Start Promo Campaign**
```bash
pnpm run shop
# ‚Üí Campaign Tools ‚Üí Create Promo Branch
# ‚Üí Select shop: shop-a
# ‚Üí Promo name: summer-fitness-sale
# ‚Üí Creates: shop-a/promo-summer-fitness-sale
```

2. **Connect to Shopify Theme**
```bash
# Shopify Admin ‚Üí shop-a store ‚Üí Themes ‚Üí Add theme
# ‚Üí Connect from GitHub  
# ‚Üí Branch: shop-a/promo-summer-fitness-sale
# ‚Üí Theme name: "Summer Fitness Sale"
```

3. **Customize in Shopify**
- Use Shopify Theme Customizer to add sale banners, pricing, etc.
- GitHub integration automatically syncs content back to `shop-a/promo-summer-fitness-sale`

4. **Launch Promo**
```bash
# Option A: Launchpad app (automated)
# Option B: Shopify Admin ‚Üí Publish theme manually
```

5. **Push Promo Content to Main**
After promo launches, keep main current:
```bash
pnpm run shop  
# ‚Üí Campaign Tools ‚Üí Push Promo to Main
# ‚Üí Creates PR: shop-a/promo-summer-fitness-sale ‚Üí shop-a/main
# ‚Üí Review shows content-only changes
# ‚Üí Merge after review
```

6. **Republish Main**
```bash
# Shopify Admin ‚Üí Publish shop-a/main theme
# ‚Üí Now main is current with promo content
```

7. **End Promo (Optional)**
```bash
pnpm run shop
# ‚Üí Campaign Tools ‚Üí End Promo
# ‚Üí Creates: shop-a/end-promo-summer-fitness-sale
# ‚Üí Based on current shop-a/main (includes code updates)
# ‚Üí Remove promo-specific content
# ‚Üí Create Shopify theme from end-promo branch
# ‚Üí Publish when ready
```

## üîÄ Contextual Development Details

### Smart Branch Detection

The `pnpm run dev` command automatically detects your context:

| Branch Pattern | Behavior | Example |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| `main` | Feature workflow | Choose shop for testing |
| `feature/*` | **Contextual development** | Choose shop for testing |
| `hotfix/*` | Feature workflow | Choose shop for testing |
| `shop-a/*` | **Auto-detected shop** | Start shop-a immediately |
| `shop-a/promo-*` | **Auto-detected shop** | Start shop-a immediately |

### Shop Context Selection

When on feature branches, you'll be prompted:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# üöÄ Contextual Development
# 
# Current branch: feature/carousel-fix
# 
# Select shop for testing:
# ‚ùØ shop-a (Fitness Store)
#   shop-b (Beauty Store)  
#   shop-c (Electronics Store)
#
# Select environment:
# ‚ùØ staging (recommended)
#   production (live store)
#
# üîó Starting Shopify CLI...
# shopify theme dev --store=staging-shop-a
```

### Credential Management

Each developer has their own credentials:
```bash
shops/credentials/shop-a.credentials.json  # Your personal tokens
shops/credentials/shop-b.credentials.json  # Your personal tokens
```

These are **never committed** - each developer sets up their own.

## üöÄ The Magic

### One Command, Smart Context
```bash
pnpm run dev  # Always works, adapts to your branch
```

**On `feature/carousel-fix`:**
- Prompts for shop selection
- Tests your feature across different brands
- Code stays on feature branch

**On `shop-a/custom-section`:**
- Auto-detects shop-a
- Starts immediately with shop-a credentials
- No shop selection needed

**On `shop-a/promo-summer-sale`:**
- Auto-detects shop-a promo context
- Starts with shop-a credentials
- Connected to promo theme in Shopify

This is **contextual development** - the same command behaves intelligently based on where you are in the workflow.
