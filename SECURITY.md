## Security Model

### Credential Protection

**shopdevs-multi-shop** implements enterprise-grade security for sensitive Shopify theme access credentials:

#### üîê **Local-Only Storage**
- Theme tokens stored in `shops/credentials/` (never committed)
- Automatic `.gitignore` configuration prevents accidental commits
- File permissions restricted to owner-only (600)

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Structured Validation**
- JSON schema validation for all configuration
- Input sanitization for user-provided data
- Credential format validation and corruption detection

#### üîç **Security Monitoring**
- Automatic security audits of credential files
- Detection of suspicious token patterns
- File permission monitoring and enforcement
- Credential age tracking for rotation recommendations

#### üö® **Threat Protection**
- Protection against credential injection attacks
- Validation of token formats and sources
- Sanitization of data before logging
- No sensitive data in error messages or logs

### Data Handling

#### **What We Store Locally:**
- Shop configuration (committed): Store domains, branch names, authentication method
- Developer credentials (local only): Personal theme access tokens/passwords

#### **What We Never Store:**
- Shopify customer data
- Payment information  
- Store analytics or sales data
- Shared/team credentials

#### **What We Never Transmit:**
- Credential data is never sent to external services
- No telemetry or analytics collection
- No remote logging of sensitive operations

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### ‚úÖ **DO:**
- Keep the package updated to latest version
- Use Theme Access App (recommended) over manual tokens
- Rotate theme access credentials periodically (every 6 months)
- Use staging environments for development and testing
- Review credential audit results regularly: `multi-shop audit security`

#### ‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Share credential files between developers
- Commit `shops/credentials/` directory to Git
- Use production credentials for development
- Store credentials in environment variables or CI/CD systems
- Ignore security audit warnings

### For Developers

#### **Credential Handling:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Correct: Use SecurityManager
const securityManager = new SecurityManager();
const token = securityManager.getThemeToken(shopId, env);

// ‚ùå Wrong: Direct file access
const rawCreds = fs.readFileSync('shops/credentials/shop.json');
```

#### **Error Handling:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Correct: Structured error handling
try {
  const config = shopManager.loadShopConfig(shopId);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ShopConfigurationError) {
    logger.error('Configuration error', { 
      shopId, 
      code: error.code 
    });
  }
}

// ‚ùå Wrong: Exposing sensitive data in errors
catch (error) {
  console.log(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(credentials)}`); // Exposes secrets!
}
```

#### **Input Validation:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Correct: Validate all inputs
const validator = new ShopConfigValidator();
const safeConfig = validator.validateConfig(userInput, shopId);

// ‚ùå Wrong: Using unvalidated input
const domain = userInput.domain; // Potential injection vector
```
